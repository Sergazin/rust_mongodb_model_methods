Revenue Sharing Clause:
If the software is used in a commercial project that generates annual gross revenue exceeding $1,000,000 USD, the user agrees to pay the original author 0.1% of their annual gross revenue derived from the project where the software is utilized. This payment is due annually and is calculated based on the gross revenue from the previous fiscal year.
